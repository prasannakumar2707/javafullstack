    <p class="para"> The morning sun spilled across the quiet street, painting
    the walls in shades of gold. A gentle breeze carried 
    the scent of blooming flowers, while birds hopped from branch to branch,
    filling the air with cheerful notes.
    It was one of those moments where time seemed to slow down, 
    inviting anyone who paused to simply breathe and enjoy the calm.</p>
